Group SLAM!â€™s repository includes the following:
2 Jupyter Notebooks (map & analyses)
1 main data file from Kaggle
1 excel file for second-round cleaning
1 README.md file
Interested in sourcing and interpreting factors that influence the housing prices of major cities in Australia, namely Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane, and Adelaide, we conducted multivariate and bivariate linear regression models alongside visualizations of a gradient map, line graphs, and bar charts to aid the process. 

What Does the Data Say? 
Conducting macroeconomic and demographic research in data analysis, results show:
State governments tend to lower mortgage rates to boost the economy, driving up housing prices. 
People associate more private space with luxury: fewer bedrooms/movement space, more bathrooms/private access.
